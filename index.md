## About me

I am a data scientist with the [Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html) at the CDC.
I was previously a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles in [Marc Suchard's](https://suchard-group.github.io) group.
Before that, I obtained my PhD candidate from the University of Washington, Seattle, co-advised by [Vladimir Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/).
These days, my primary research interests center on the development and application of (especially Bayesian) phylogenetic methods to address the evolution and spread of infectious diseases.
I have also worked on macroevolutionary phylogenetics, model adequacy, and efficient inference methodology.
If you have questions about phylogenetics, feel free to send me an email.
