## About me

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle, co-advised by [Vladimir Minin](https://vnminin.github.io/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/).
My research is on Bayesian phylogenetic methods, including birth-death models for macroevolutionary and phylodynamic applications, model adequacy, and improved inference methodology.
If you have questions about phylogenetics, feel free to send me an email.
